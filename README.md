## AtliQ Hardware-Sales-Analysis using Power BI and SQL

### Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware, a computer hardware and peripheral manufacturer with branches across India, is facing declining sales and difficulties in assessing business performance. The sales director struggles to obtain accurate insights, as regional managers find it challenging to interpret data from Excel files. This lack of clarity hinders their ability to identify trends, understand customer preferences, manage inventory, and optimize marketing efforts, resulting in missed growth opportunities.

To address these issues, AtliQ Hardware needs a solution that clearly visualizes sales patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making. This project aims to enhance sales performance, meet financial goals, and improve overall business operations.
