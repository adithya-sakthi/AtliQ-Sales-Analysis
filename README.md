## AtliQ Hardware-Sales-Analysis

### AtliQ Hardware
- Is a company which supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients across India;
- The company has a head office in Dehli and regional offices throughout India.

### Business Issue
The sales director is facing a lot of challenges such as:
The marketing is growing dynamically and then he’s struggling in terms of tracking the sales, needing more accurate insights about the company sales, and then making the necessary decisions.

### Tools used:
I used SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to take a look into the data and Power BI for ETL and visualizations to create the insights.

## KPIs
• Revenue: sum of the amount

• Total Profit Margin (TPM) = sum(profit margin)

• Profit Margin % = TPM/Revenue then select "Percentage" data type

• Profit Margin Contribution (PMC) = TPM/TPM(All sales products, all sales customers, all markets)

For e.g total of 50 bucks profit and out of it "Delhi" brings 10 bucks profit then PMC will be (10/50)*100= 20% profit
